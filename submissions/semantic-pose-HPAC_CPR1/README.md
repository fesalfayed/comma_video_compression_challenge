# semantic-pose-HPAC_CPR1

This is the clean submission stage for the self-compressed integer-HPAC
candidate. The canonical CPR1 `archive.zip` is `191,052` bytes with SHA-256:

[Download the canonical archive](https://github.com/fesalfayed/comma_video_compression_challenge/releases/download/semantic-pose-HPAC_CPR1/archive.zip).
The complete approach and experiment history are covered in the
[technical write-up](https://fesalfayed.com/blog/semantic-pose-compression/).
Prior work, inherited mechanisms, original-contribution boundaries, and
immutable citations are documented in
[`LINEAGE_AND_CITATIONS.md`](LINEAGE_AND_CITATIONS.md).

Do not replace the published `archive.zip` with a rebuild unless the result is
byte-identical to the size and SHA-256 above. Any different archive is a new
and unverified candidate.

## Lossless Repack Result

CPR1 reduces the frozen `194,380`-byte archive by `3,328` bytes without
changing the decoded semantic renderer, pose basis, pose coefficients, HPAC
model, or semantic-token stream. The new exact compression rate is
`0.005088547388475883`.

Applying that rate to the displayed metrics from the frozen archive's two
completed official CUDA validations gives:

| Source validator | PoseNet | SegNet | CPR1 score from displayed metrics |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| RTX 2000 Ada | 0.00001967 | 0.00028609 | approximately 0.169847662 |
| RTX A4500 (Ampere) | 0.00001981 | 0.00029607 | approximately 0.170895485 |

The conservative A4500 projection is about `0.007653215` below the
`0.178548700` landslide threshold. Because the official report rounds
distortions to eight decimal places, that projected score lies approximately in
`[0.170893209, 0.170897761]`. These are projections from already displayed
metrics, not a claim of hidden evaluator precision or a replacement for the
pending official T4 result.

## Exact Equivalence

`repack_carrier.py` accepts only the frozen source archive with SHA-256
`f4457de09a6e69c8cd29e886a84705462a8c77dc6978020b11dff52e661a1451`.
It decodes the legacy carrier, encodes CPR1, decodes CPR1 again, and requires
exact equality of every stored symbol before writing a deterministic ZIP.

The golden integration test then loads the old and new archives through the
submission decoder and requires `torch.equal` for every semantic state tensor,
the complete pose basis, and all `7,200` pose coefficients. The HPAC model and
token bitstream remain byte-identical. Fourteen codec, malformed-stream, and
frozen-golden test cases pass, including 200 deterministic randomized carrier
round trips. The locked decoded hashes are:

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Semantic state | `de0e5fc616b75eb0bdb55528aa61a7405eebbd3a81064f513adfbb69b33105ba` |
| Pose basis tensor | `7a6576e991a068e084ffc12f6377b9bfcc00fd2529eb8df27c424921f3c3933b` |
| Pose coefficient tensor | `dee2587ec99eea45e76ebd68eaaad3e3ae52d51e0a9b673103be8d4128e07ca8` |
| HPAC packed model | `b07fff73fac41c5fec2d8acbfd7c43c518852696f18d95cf7465fc6ed7510b58` |
| Semantic token stream | `948379872ff81a4e5d948ec301c143be00ebd0033544c8abdfb4af0f4c4a15eb` |

The CPR1 archive also completed a full CPU entropy replay: all `600` frames
decoded in `2,197.6` seconds, and the resulting `600 x 384 x 512` token tensor
matched SHA-256
`c5c7671d037b6912980c57929a5b6d789d250ee6a93e3b0a6018cf9f63e32ece`.

## Compression Reproduction

`compress.sh` and `repack_carrier.py` are the exact final lossless compression
stage used for CPR1. The script accepts the frozen `194,380`-byte predecessor
archive, or downloads it from the pinned release asset, and requires SHA-256
`f4457de09a6e69c8cd29e886a84705462a8c77dc6978020b11dff52e661a1451`.
It then encodes the canonical Huffman and Rice streams, verifies every decoded
symbol, writes a deterministic ZIP, and refuses success unless the result is
exactly `191,052` bytes with the published CPR1 SHA-256.

```bash
bash submissions/semantic-pose-HPAC_CPR1/compress.sh \
  --output /tmp/semantic-pose-cpr1/archive.zip \
  --report /tmp/semantic-pose-cpr1/repack.json
```

This is the exact frozen-source CPR1 compression/repacking stage, not the
multi-day model-fitting pipeline from the original video. The predecessor is a
compression-side provenance input. It is never loaded during inflation and
does not bypass the charged payload.

## Portability Evidence

The source archive's two validations used:

- challenge commit `d3f688f84f555c5aaebee7d2c4203efc8a9051e2`;
- freshly pulled official PoseNet, SegNet, video, and video-name LFS objects;
- `torch 2.9.0+cu128`, CUDA 12.8, `constriction 0.4.2`, and NumPy 2.3.4;
- the official command:

```bash
uv run --group cu128 bash evaluate.sh \
  --device cuda \
  --submission-dir ./submissions/semantic-pose-HPAC_CPR1
```

The independent A4500 run used driver `550.90.07`, decoded all 600
arithmetic-coded token frames, rendered all 1,200 camera frames, scored all 600
pairs, and exited zero in 3 minutes 42 seconds. Its inflated output was
`3,662,409,600` bytes with SHA-256:

```text
60ead43617ef8fcfa692074d9fc9021947dbd7e47e1ad7654b7239df493d9af2
```

The Ada output hash was
`8b5e62294db79ec3b7fb19d8805bf6af3184d37ddf15ae5ed2d1b9f0cbdc448b`.
The renderer uses GPU floating-point kernels, so raw output and metric
bit-identity are not claimed across GPU architectures. The entropy portability
gate is that the exact bitstream decodes all 600 frames and the complete
official evaluator succeeds.

As a stricter entropy-only check, the preserved source decoder recomputed every
quantized probability table on the A4500. Its full logit SHA-256 exactly matched
the encoder's recorded value:

```text
33fd711b305efb12ab9f7363c1404229996b79b8e27896f20ed910e98f105f75
```

The decoded raw semantic-token tensor has SHA-256
`c5c7671d037b6912980c57929a5b6d789d250ee6a93e3b0a6018cf9f63e32ece`.

This fixes the hardware-pinned arithmetic-decoder failure in the retired
floating-point SPLM archive. CPR1 changes only the lossless pose-carrier
representation. It does not replace the final GitHub `linux-nvidia-t4` run;
T4 CI remains the hardware-specific gate.

## Representation

The archive contains all charged model data and tokens:

- a `40,252`-byte quantized semantic renderer for the second frame of each pair;
- a `23,054`-byte CPR1 low-rank gray pose carrier for the first frame;
- a `20,179`-byte integer-lattice HPAC entropy model;
- a `116,980`-byte self-compressed semantic token stream.

Within the submission's fixed tensor schema, CPR1 is self-delimiting. It stores
the original 32-symbol pose basis with a canonical Huffman table and the
original 12 coefficient time series with exact per-dimension Rice parameters.
Its header, scales, and tables are all charged to the archive. The carrier
round-trips every original 5-bit basis symbol and 12-bit delta/zigzag
coefficient code exactly.

No external neural model or uncharged data artifact is loaded during inflation.
